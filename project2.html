            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Kohli,
                worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas,
                 and an older sister, Bhawna.[6] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education
                  at Vishal Bharti Public School.[7] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere 
                  three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.[8]

In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WCDA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour 
for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma, 
who initially perceived him to be just another enthusiastic and determined young boy. However, two weeks later, 
Sharma was impressed by Kohli's accuracy and power in throwing.[9] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, 
Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that 
his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.
